-- | 'PostBuild' represents an action that is notified via an 'Event' when it
-- has finished executing.  Note that the specific definition of "finished" is
-- determined by the instance of 'PostBuild', but the intent is to allow
-- 'Behavior's and 'Dynamic's to be safely sampled, regardless of where they
-- were created, when the post-build 'Event' fires.  The post-build 'Event' will
-- fire exactly once for an given action.
class (Reflex t, Monad m) => PostBuild t m | m -> t where
  -- | Retrieve the post-build 'Event' for this action.
