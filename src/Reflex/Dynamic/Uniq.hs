-- | A 'Dynamic' whose 'updated' 'Event' will never fire with the same value as
-- the 'current' 'Behavior''s contents.  In order to maintain this constraint,
-- the value inside a 'UniqDynamic' is always evaluated to
-- <https://wiki.haskell.org/Weak_head_normal_form weak head normal form>.
--
-- Internally, 'UniqDynamic' uses pointer equality as a heuristic to avoid
-- unnecessary update propagation; this is much more efficient than performing
-- full comparisons.  However, when the 'UniqDynamic' is converted back into a
-- regular 'Dynamic', a full comparison is performed.

--
-- WARNING: If used with a type whose 'Eq' instance is not law-abiding -
-- specifically, if there are cases where @x /= x@, 'fromUniqDynamic' may
-- eliminate more 'updated' occurrences than it should.  For example, NaN values
-- of 'Double' and 'Float' are considered unequal to themselves by the 'Eq'
-- instance, but can be equal by pointer equality.  This may cause 'UniqDynamic'
-- to lose changes from NaN to NaN.

    -- achieve nondeterminism by constructing elements that are identical in
    -- value, unequal according to 'Eq', and nondeterministically equal or
    -- nonequal by pointer quality.  I suspect that it is impossible to make the
