-- | This is used to sample the value of a 'Behavior' using an 'Event'.

-- the 'Applicative' instance for 'Behavior'.
--
-- This is useful when we want to combine the values of one 'Event' and
-- the value of several 'Behavior's at the time the 'Event' is firing.
--
-- If we have:
--
-- > f  :: a -> b -> c -> d
-- > b1 :: Behavior t a
-- > b2 :: Behavior t b
-- > e  :: Event t c
--
-- then we can do:
--
-- > f <$> b1 <*> b2 <@> e :: Event t d
--
-- in order to apply the function 'f' to the relevant values.
--
-- The alternative would be something like:
--
-- > attachWith (\(x1, x2) y -> f x1 x2 y) ((,) <$> b1 <*> b2) e :: Event t d
--
-- or a variation involing a custom data type to hold the combination of
-- 'Behavior's even when that combination might only ever be used by 'f'.
--
-- A more suggestive example might be:
--
-- > handleMouse <$> bPlayerState <*> bMousePosition <@> eMouseClick :: Event t (GameState -> GameState)
--
(<@>) :: Reflex t => Behavior t (a -> b) -> Event t a -> Event t b
(<@>) b = push $ \x -> do
  f <- sample b
  return . Just . f $ x
infixl 4 <@>

-- | An version of '<@>' that does not use the value of the 'Event'.
--
-- Alternatively, it is 'tag' in operator form.
--
-- This is useful when we want to combine the values of several
-- 'Behavior's at particular points in time using an 'Applicative'
-- style syntax.
--
-- If we have:
--
-- > g  :: a -> b -> d
-- > b1 :: Behavior t a
-- > b2 :: Behavior t b
-- > e  :: Event t c
--
-- where 'e' is firing at the points in time of interest.
--
-- Then we can use '<@':
--
-- > g <$> b1 <*> b2 <@  e :: Event t d
--
-- to combine the values of 'b1' and 'b2' at each of those points of time,
-- with the function 'g' being used to combine the values.
--
-- This is the same as '<@>' except that the 'Event' is being used only
-- to act as a trigger.
