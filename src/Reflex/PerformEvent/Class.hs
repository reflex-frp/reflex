  -- the triggering action.
  type Performable m :: * -> *
  -- | Perform the action contained in the given 'Event' whenever the 'Event'
  -- fires.  Return the result in another 'Event'.  Note that the output 'Event'
  -- will generally occur later than the input 'Event', since most 'Performable'
  -- actions cannot be performed during 'Event' propagation.
  performEvent :: Event t (Performable m a) -> m (Event t a)
  -- | Like 'performEvent', but do not return the result.  May have slightly
  -- better performance.
  performEvent_ :: Event t (Performable m ()) -> m ()

-- | Like 'performEvent', but the resulting 'Event' occurs only when the
-- callback (@a -> IO ()@) is called, not when the included action finishes.
--
-- NOTE: Despite the name, 'performEventAsync' does not run its action in a
-- separate thread - although the action is free to invoke forkIO and then call
-- the callback whenever it is ready.  This will work properly, even in GHCJS
-- (which fully implements concurrency even though JavaScript does not have
-- built in concurrency).
