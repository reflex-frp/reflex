-- Module:
--   Reflex.Workflow
-- Description:
--   Provides a convenient way to describe a series of interrelated widgets that
--   can send data to, invoke, and replace one another. Useful for modeling user interface
--   "workflows."

-- | A widget in a workflow
-- When the 'Event' returned by a 'Workflow' fires, the current 'Workflow' is replaced by the one inside the firing 'Event'. A series of 'Workflow's must share the same return type.

-- | Runs a 'Workflow' and returns the 'Dynamic' result of the 'Workflow' (i.e., a 'Dynamic' of the value produced by the current 'Workflow' node, and whose update 'Event' fires whenever one 'Workflow' is replaced by another).

-- | Similar to 'workflow', but outputs an 'Event' that fires at post-build time and whenever the current 'Workflow' is replaced by the next 'Workflow'.
