# Revision history for reflex

## Unreleased

* Generalize `fan` to `fanG` to take a `DMap` with non-`Identity`
  values.

* Generalize merging functions:
  `merge` to `mergeG`, 
  `mergeIncremental` to `mergeIncrementalG`, 
  `distributeDMapOverDynPure` to `distributeDMapOverDynPureG`,
  `mergeIncrementalWithMove` to `mergeIncrementalWithMoveG`.  


## 0.6.2.0

* Fix `holdDyn` so that it is lazy in its event argument  
  These produce `DMap`s  whose values needn't be `Identity`.
* Stop using the now-deprecated `*Tag` classes (e.g., `ShowTag`).
* Fix `holdDyn` so that it is lazy in its event argument.

## 0.6.1.0

* Re-export all of `Data.Map.Monoidal`
* Fix `QueryT` and `RequesterT` tests

## 0.6.0.0 -- 2019-03-20

* Deprecate `FunctorMaybe` in favor of `Data.Witherable.Filterable`. We still export `fmapMaybe`, `ffilter`, etc., but they all rely on `Filterable` now.
* Rename `MonadDynamicWriter` to `DynamicWriter` and add a deprecation for the old name.
* Remove many deprecated functions.
* Add a `Num` instance for `Dynamic`.
* Add `matchRequestsWithResponses` to make it easier to use `Requester` with protocols that don't do this matching for you.
* Add `withRequesterT` to map functions over the request and response of a `RequesterT`.
* Suppress nil patches in `QueryT` as an optimization. The `Query` type must now have an `Eq` instance.
* Add `throttleBatchWithLag` to `Reflex.Time`. See that module for details.
