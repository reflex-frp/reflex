### Practical Functional Reactive Programming

Reflex is an fully-deterministic, higher-order Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) interface and an engine that efficiently implements that interface.

[Reflex-DOM](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-dom) is a framework built on Reflex that facilitates the development of web pages, including highly-interactive single-page apps.

A summary of Reflex functions is available in the [quick reference](Quickref.md).

### Hacking

Use the `./scripts/hackon reflex` script in [Reflex Platform](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-platform) to checkout the source code of `reflex` locally in `reflex-platform/reflex` directory.
Then do modifications to the source in place, and use the `./tryreflex` or `./scripts/workon` scripts to create the shell to test your changes.
